# Code Quiz

## Description

This application is an assesment to test the users knowledge of Javascript. Once the user clicks "Start", the first question will appear. 

Once the user selects an answer choice, the selection will turn green if the response was correct, and red if it was incorrect. Each correct answer will result in 10 points added to the final score. 

Once all questions have been answered, the users final score will be displayed at the top of the page.

The user can refresh the page to retake the assesment. Each time the assesment is taken, the questions will be shuffled so that they do not appear in the same order each time. 

You can preview the application in the screenshots below, or you can visit the live website here:
